      <h4>A Better Business Model</h4>
      <p>
        Ads are annoying, and they make very little money for all the inconvenience they cause. There has to be a better way to monetize your content. With Browzable, you can charge your viewers directly based on how much they watch. Viewers pay $10 for 1,000 minutes, and as they play videos the minutes transfer to the creators, who get 70% of the earnings. 
      </p>
      <h4>Get Started</h4>
      <p>Simply upload your videos to Browzable. You will get a profile page which has all your videos. All you have to do is direct viewers to your Browzable page. Viewers will have to sign up before they can watch, but everyone gets 100 free minutes so they can start right away.
